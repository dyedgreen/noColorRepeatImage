# No Color Repeat Image

This simple web-thing turns boring images into images
where each color is used only once. All the computation
is done on the client side in Javascript. Hence this might
be rather slow and images are restricted to a max 300x300 px.

The nearest color search is using an naive bruteforce approach.
However it was optimized for speed a little and tries as little
options as necessary. If you want to know how it works exactly,
feel free to take a look at `main.js`.

Have a good day ✌️
